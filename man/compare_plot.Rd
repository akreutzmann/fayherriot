\title{Shows plots for the comparison of estimates}
\usage{
compare_plot(object, indicator, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{indicator}{optional character vector that selects which indicators
shall be returned: (i) all calculated indicators ("all");
(ii) each indicator name: "Mean", "Quantile_10", "Quantile_25", "Median",
"Quantile_75", "Quantile_90", "Head_Count",
"Poverty_Gap", "Gini", "Quintile_Share" or the function name/s of
"custom_indicator/s"; (iii) groups of indicators: "Quantiles", "Poverty",
"Inequality" or "Custom".If two of these groups are selected, only the first
one is returned. Defaults to "all". Note, additional custom indicators can be
defined as argument for model-based approaches (see also \code{\link{ebp}})
and do not appear in groups of indicators even though these might belong to
one of the groups.}

\item{direct}{optional, an object of type "emdi","direct", representing point
and MSE estimates.}

\item{model}{an object of type "emdi","model", representing point and MSE
estimates.}
}
\value{
A scatter plot and a line plot comparing direct and model-based
estimators for each selected indicator obtained by \code{\link[ggplot2]{ggplot}}.
}
\description{
For all indicators or a selection of indicators two plots are returned. The
first plot is a scatter plot of estimates to compare and the second is a line
plot with these estimates.
