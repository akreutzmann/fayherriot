Title: Working example for the Fay-Herriot estimation with arcsin transformation used in the paper 

Version: 0.1

Description: The working example provides data and R code to run the Fay-Herriot function with arcsin transformation described in the paper. The working example consists of three files: “testdata.RData” contains the relevant data to run the working example. “Working example.R” gives some basic R code to load the test data, to run the function and to show the output. The Fay-Herriot function with arcsin transformation is provided in the file “FU-function-arcsin.R”. Here, the required inputs are further described as well. THis file provides some additional explanations for how to run the working example.
